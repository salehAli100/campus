          <p class="item ">Diego Armando Maradona (Spanish: [ˈdjeɣo maɾaˈðona]; 30 October 1960 – 25 November 2020) 
              was an Argentine professional football player and manager. Widely regarded as one of
               the greatest players in the history of the sport, he was one of the two joint 
               winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th Century award. Maradona's vision, 
               passing, ball control, and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature, 
               which gave him a low centre of gravity allowing him to manoeuvre better than most other players.
